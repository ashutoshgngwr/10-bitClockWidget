      10-bit Clock Widget uses 10 binary dots and their color to represent
      current time in 12-hour format. In the following image, first 4 dots
      (before separator line) represents hour (0-11), other 6 dots represent
      minutes (0-59) and color of these dots denotes A.M./P.M. as defined in
      widget settings. Furthermore, dim dots are 0s and bright dots are 1s, so
      in following image, first 4 dots denote 1010 (10) and other 6 dots denote
      010011 (19).
